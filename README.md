# Hi, I'm Álvaro! 👋

Passionate about web programming with a solid experience in a wide range of languages ​​and technologies. My main focus is on both BackEnd and FrontEnd development, allowing me to create complete and efficient solutions.
In addition, I have recently obtained the certification as a Scrum Master, which has allowed me to combine my technical skills with agile methodologies. This enables me to lead development teams, improve collaboration and ensure the delivery of high-quality projects on time and in a timely manner.
